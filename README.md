## Features

> Note: in practice, it is unnecessary to code-split for an app of this size (where each async chunk is only a few kilobytes), nor is it optimal to extract an extra CSS file (which is only 1kb) -- they are used simply because this is a demo app showcasing all the supported features. In real apps, you should always measure and optimize based on your actual app constraints.
